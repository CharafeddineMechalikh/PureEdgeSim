	 * This is a simple example showing how to launch simulation using a custom
	 * network model. The CustomNetworkModel.java is located under the examples/f
	 * older. As you can see, this class extends the MainApplication class provided
	 * by PureEdgeSim, which is required for this example to work.
	 * 
	 * In this example, we will implement the cooperative caching algorithm
	 * presented in the following paper: Mechalikh, C., Taktak, H., Moussa, F.:
	 * Towards a Scalable and QoS-Aware Load Balancing Platform for Edge Computing
	 * Environments. The 2019 International Conference on High Performance Computing
	 * & Simulation (2019) 684-691

	/**
	 * Before running this example you need to
	 * 
	 * 1/ enable the registry in the simulation parameters file by setting
	 * enable_registry=true registry_mode=CACHE
	 * 
	 * 2/ enable orchestrators in the simulation parameters file by setting
	 * enable_orchestrators=true deploy_orchestrator=CLUSTER
	 * 
	 * you can then compare between registry_mode=CLOUD in which the containers are
	 * downloaded from the cloud everytime and registry_mode=CACHE in which the
	 * frequently needed containers are cached in edge devices. Same for
	 * deploy_orchestrator=CLUSTER and deploy_orchestrator=CLOUD. where the
	 * orchestrators are deployed on the cluster heads or on the cloud.
	 * 
	 * Try to use the MIST_ONLY architecture, in order to see clearly the difference
	 * in WAN usage (no tasks offloading to the cloud, so the wan will only be used
	 * by containers). To see the effect, try with 60 minutes simulation time.
	 * 
	 * You will see that the cooperative caching algorithm decreases the WAN usage
	 * remarkably.
