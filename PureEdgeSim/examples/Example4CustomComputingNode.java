 * To create your own custom edge device/data center class, you need to extend the DataCenter class first.
 * Then you can add any methods you want. 
 * 
 * In this example we extended the DefaultDataCenter class (which extends the DataCenter class) instead of the DataCenter class, in order to remove code duplication 
 * (so we don't have to copy and paste the energy consumption and the CPU utilization functions of the DefaultDataCenter class). 
 * If we needed to change it, we would have extended the DataCenter class, and write our custom updateEnergyConsumption() function.
