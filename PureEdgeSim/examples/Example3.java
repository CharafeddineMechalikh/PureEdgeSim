	/**
	 * This example we propose a simulation scenario where a Edge data
	 * centers/servers work cooperatively.
	 * 
	 * To do this, first, we defined the Edge data centers characteristics in the
	 * edge_datacenters.xml file (in PureEdgeSim\examples\Example9_settings\)
	 * 
	 * Then, in the simulation_parameters.properties file, we used the
	 * Edge_and_Cloud architecture, which means the tasks will be offloaded to the
	 * Edge data centers or to the Cloud. Edge data centers are linked, the topology
	 * is given in edge_datacenters.xml file.
	 * 
	 * We also enabled the deployment of orchestrators on physical devices by
	 * setting: enable_orchestrators=true
	 * 
	 * An orchestrator will be deployed on each Edge dat cetner:
	 * deploy_orchestrator=EDGE
	 * 
	 * By doing so, the tasks will be sent to the nearest orchestrator (which is the
	 * nearest edge data center). This orchestrator will decide whether to offlaod the
	 * tasks to the cloud , to another edge data center, or to execute them locally,
	 * depending on the orchestration algorithm
