/**
 * In this example we show how to implement a Fuzzy Logic based orchestration
 * algorithm, we tried to implement this algorithm but with a little
 * modification in order to support mist computing (computing at the extreme
 * edge). The algorithm can be found in this paper here:
 * 
 * C. Sonmez, A. Ozgovde and C. Ersoy, "Fuzzy Workload Orchestration for Edge
 * Computing," in IEEE Transactions on Network and Service Management, vol. 16,
 * no. 2, pp. 769-782, June 2019.
 * 
 * We also started with stage 2 and then stage 1, as this decreases the
 * algorithm complexity. Hence, shorter simulation time.
 * 
 * To use it you must add JFuzzy_Logic jar file PureEdgeSim/Libs/ folder
