 * The {@code PureEdgeSim} class represents the discrete event simulation (DES)

 * {@link com.mechalikh.pureedgesim.simulationmanager.SimulationThread
 * SimulationThread} in the
 * {@link com.mechalikh.pureedgesim.simulationmanager.SimulationThread#startSimulation()

 * startSimulation()} method of the
 * {@link com.mechalikh.pureedgesim.simulationmanager.SimulationManager
 * SimulationManager} is called.
 * <p>
 * Once the PureEdgeSim simulation engine has started, it notifies all
 * simulation entities of the start of the simulation in order to schedule their
 * first event. This is guaranteed by the {@link SimEntity#startInternal()
