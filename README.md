<p align="justify">
PureEdgeSim is a simulation framework that enables to study Internet of Things on a large scale, as a 
distributed, dynamic, and highly heterogeneous infrastructure, as well as the applications 
that run on these things. It features realistic infrastructure models, allowing research on the edge-to-cloud continuum to be conducted. It
encompasses all layers of edge computing modeling and simulation.
It features a modular design in which each module addresses a particular aspect of the 
simulation. The Datacenters Manager module, for example, is concerned with the creation 
of data centers, servers, as well as end devices and their heterogeneity. Their geo-distribution 
and mobility, however, are handled by the Location Manager module. Similarly, the 
Network Module is in charge of bandwidth allocation and data transfer. </p>

<p align="justify">
PureEdgeSim brings together analytical and numerical modeling techniques. The 
network, for example, is modeled by means of adjustable mathematical equations rather than 
at a low level. Such abstraction facilitates simulating thousands of edge devices and 
guarantees the evaluation of the simulation state at any moment. Finally, since PureEdgeSim 
is a discrete event simulator, the characteristics of the simulated environment, like network 
traffic and resources’ utilization, will evolve over time, thereby enabling support for online 
decision-making algorithms, a process that can be accomplished through the Workload 
Orchestrator module.</p>

<br clear="left"/>
<p align="justify">
Each module provides a default implementation along with a set of adjustable settings to 
facilitate prototyping and experimentation. Thus, researchers can effortlessly implement 
their approaches without having to waste time specifying low-level details. Another key 
feature of PureEdgeSim is its extensibility, as it allows users to create and incorporate their 
own models without altering its codebase when the default models fail to satisfy their needs.
In discrete event simulators, the temporal complexity of the simulation is dependent on the 
number of events produced at runtime. To reduce simulation duration, PureEdgeSim allows 
for balancing the precision of the simulation and its duration thanks to a set of dedicated 
parameters. How precise the simulation will rely on the user’s settings, particularly the 
update intervals. Thus, the simulation will be more precise and realistic the shorter these 
intervals are, but it will also last longer. You can read more in the <a href="https://github.com/CharafeddineMechalikh/PureEdgeSim/wiki">WiKi</a></p>.

### Efficiency and Scalability 

<img width= "20%" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/46229052/196665651-e27976b0-8908-4a75-ac54-dc838c7abf52.png" align="right" />


<p align="justify">
A system is said to be efficient when it can maintain a specified level of proficiency without utilizing an excessive amount of resources, i.e., execution time and memory. Determining the theoretical time complexity of the given simulation is not trivial because the execution time depends entirely on the user scenario (i.e., the devices and tasks count, the mobility model, the types of resources, etc.) and the number of events that occur during the simulation. Furthermore, some parameters strongly influence the number of simulations and, obviously, the number of runs also directly influences the execution time.
To demonstrate the scalability of PureEdgeSim, a few experiments were conducted on a single Intel Core i7-8550U.
</p>
<br clear="left"/>

>  A 10-minute simulation scenario with 10000 devices (which generated 1131000 tasks) took 58 seconds. 
>
>  A 24-hour simulation scenario with 200 devices (total of 3221280 generated tasks generated) took 51 seconds. 
>
>  A 60-minute scenario with 100 devices took only 1 seconds.

<p align="justify">
Of course, this time is highly dependent on the complexity of the decision making algorithm itself and the number of generated events  (as more devices = more tasks = more events), which is why it took longer with 10,000 devices. That said, it is still faster than real-time and outperforms all CloudSim/ CloudSim plus based simulators that either struggle to start due to the large number of devices or run out of memory due to the large number of events generated.</p>
<p align="justify">
It is therefore easy to conclude that PureEdgeSim meets the “efficiency and scalability” criteria as it allows for simulated experiments involving hundreds if not thousands of devices and tasks and runs considerably faster than in wall-clock time. An important step to reduce the simulation duration and solve its dependency on the number of runs is to implement multi-threading to execute simulation runs in parallel, which is already supported by PureEdgeSim.

</p>

<p align="center">PureEdgeSim support for large-scale scenarios</p>

### Simulation Accuracy

<p align="justify">
As mentioned previously, PureEdgeSim offers the most realistic network, energy, and mobility models as compared to existing solutions. However, since it is a DES, the time complexity of the simulation is dependent on the number of events generated at runtime. To decrease simulation time, PureEdgeSim provides fast and complete control over the simulation environment by its collection of parameters, allowing users to compromise between simulation precision and length. Hence, how accurate the simulation is will be influenced by the user’s settings, particularly the update intervals. The shorter these intervals, the more precise and realistic the simulation, but also the longer it takes. 
</p>

### Versatiliy and Wide Applicability

<p align="justify">
If we classify edge computing and its related paradigms based on their placement in the IoT architecture, we will have three categories, each with specific properties. For example, paradigms of the perception layer like mist computing rely on resource-constrained devices, that can join or leave the network at any moment.
</p>

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/46229052/196697530-fa0e8316-6f6e-4d0c-9024-6c8386a24324.png#gh-light-mode-only)

<p align="center">The computing paradigms supported by PureEdgeSim</p>

<p align="justify">
Accordingly, the model must be versatile enough to support all kinds of resources and topologies. For this, PureEdgeSim dedicates a configuration file for each layer. The computing nodes, be they mobile devices, servers, or data centers, are all defined in these files. For instance,  this figure shows how a smartphone is modeled. As you can see, a set of attributes is also provided to specify the remaining characteristics, such as power consumption rates and mobility.

### Ease of Use 

<img width= "20%" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/46229052/196668625-54203eac-5472-4c0e-ade2-39bc1e6e5d21.png" align="right" />

<p align="justify">Simulators can be used to determine which factors have the greatest impact on performance, by evaluating different configurations, for example, the number of generated entities, the types of resources, the network settings, etc. Dealing with all these parameters programmatically can be challenging. Software is said to be usable if it can be easily comprehended and run by any user. While the usability of PureEdgeSim may be limited by the fact that a lot of <a href="https://github.com/CharafeddineMechalikh/PureEdgeSim/wiki">specific foundational knowledge</a> is required, from a technical standpoint, it is implemented as a simple application, with only a <a href="#how-to-use">few steps to follow to run the simulation</a>.The provided Javadoc documentation and <a href="https://github.com/CharafeddineMechalikh/PureEdgeSim/tree/master/PureEdgeSim/examples">simulation examples</a> offer proper guidance to the user, and the console directly informs the user of any type of incorrect input. To save time and effort, each module comes with a default implementation (e.g., the Default Mobility Model, the Default Computing Node class, etc.). These off-the-shelf models also provide a highly customizable environment with a multitude of settings, so users can adjust their behavior without changing their original code. These parameters are preset, which also decreases the complexity of the tool.</p>

<br clear="left"/>

### Extensibility

<img width= "20%" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/46229052/196666860-fc166c82-21f8-48e3-80a6-342d4c3ae11b.png" align="right" />

<p align="justify">
Another key feature of PureEdgeSim is its high extensibility. It provides code reusability and ensures adherence to software engineering guidelines and principles for improvements, accuracy, and extensibility. Although it uses its pre-built models by default, users can still create and incorporate their customized ones into their simulation scenarios if any of these default implementations do not meet their needs, all while not changing the PureEdgeSim code base. An example is provided below to show how custom models can be effortlessly integrated to the simulation.
</p>

<br clear="left"/>

```js
//Create a PureEdgeSim simulation
Simulation sim = new Simulation();

// To use your custom mobility model instead of the default one:
sim.setCustomMobilityModel(YourCustomMobilityModel.class);

// To change the tasks orchestrator:
sim.setCustomEdgeOrchestrator(YourCustomOrchestrator.class);
		
// To change the computing node class:
sim.setCustomComputingNode(YourCustomComputingNode.class);
		
// To change the tasks generator:
sim.setCustomTaskGenerator(YourCustomTaskGenerator.class); 
		
// To change the network model
sim.setCustomNetworkModel(YourCustomNetworkModel.class); 
		
// To change the simulation manager
sim.setCustomSimulationManager(YourCustomSimulationManager.class); 

// To change the topology
sim.setCustomTopologyCreator(YourCustomTopologyCreator.class); 
		
/* to use the default models you can simply delete or comment those lines */

// Finally, you can launch the simulation
sim.launchSimulation();
```

### Correctness

<p align="justify">
The tool is said to be correct if it fully complies with the stated requirements, which can be verified by checking test cases. To verify PureEdgeSim’s correctness through unit and integration testing, several test cases have been implemented. Nevertheless, this alone does not provide an assessment of which portions of the code were tested and which were not, neither gives a percentage of the overall coverage of tests alongside the project source code. To evaluate the amount of code that the available unit tests cover, code coverage reports were added to the project with the help of the Java Code Coverage Library (JaCoCo). 
It is important to clarify that the concern of such test cases is the technical feasibility of the scenarios and not the evaluation of the simulation outcome. It is simply a matter of testing whether the given results are logically reasonable and not of actually validating them. To validate the software, a case study was conducted using the simulator. <a href="https://app.codacy.com/gh/CharafeddineMechalikh/PureEdgeSim/dashboard?utm_source=github.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=CharafeddineMechalikh/PureEdgeSim&utm_campaign=Badge_Coverage">At least 90% of PureEdgeSim code is covered by those tests</a>. This achievement was made possible by testing all the new features and also by the considerable decrease in code duplication since duplicating code brings neglect of testing. </p>

<p align="justify">
In conclusion, we can say that the proposed simulator performs as intended. Every function has finished without abortions and gave the expected output; All the input files were parsed successfully, and all the personalized models were integrated and verified with the predicted results. The plotting of the simulation results gave a reasonable graphical output. In terms of intended errors, such as incorrect inputs, proper error messages were displayed, and correct information was written into the log file. Moreover, the parameters can be modified, stored, and loaded without any error.
</p>

### Reliability 

<img width= "20%" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/46229052/196667682-5c506d9f-0b00-455b-b9d1-196f93d7ba76.png" align="right" />

<p align="justify">
Reliability is the ability of a system to operate consistently under specified conditions while meeting all requirements. When it comes to the components of PureEdgeSim, reliability is ensured by extensive exception handling that catches any error occurring at runtime. Consequently, the errors will not cause the execution to stop (unless they are related to critical parameters without which the simulation cannot continue). While testing it, the proposed simulator never froze and satisfied all functional requirements. Furthermore, data reliability is high since the models are read-only and unmodifiable, meaning no data loss is to be feared. The only files that can be modified are the output files and the configuration files, which can be restored easily to the default values. In addition, PureEdgeSim uses two continuous integration services: Travis  and AppVeyor, that automate tests and builds execution on Linux and Windows virtual machines, respectively. PureEdgeSim’s users will benefit from such services as any test or build failure will be communicated promptly, thus, ensuring greater reliability.
