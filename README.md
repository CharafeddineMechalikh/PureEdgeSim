## Version 5.0 Changelog (Mar 30th 2022)
 
*   Removed CloudSim Plus (Just by doing this, the time complexity has been reduced by more than 10 times. But, we are still relying on their efficient implementation of Events Queue).

*   Support of scenarios involving tens of thousands of devices. Compared to the previous version, the same simulation scenario (10 minutes simulation time, 10 000 devices, yes 10 thousands) took  1 minutes and 12 seconds on version 5.0 vs ... well the simulation didn't even start after more than 10 minutes, so I just canceled it. This is due to CloudSim Plus huge number of events, especially the broker and the vm allocation policy ones. A scenario of 10 minutes simulation time with 2000 devices, on the other hand, took 8 seconds on version 5.0 vs 2 minutes, 54 seconds on version 4.2. Even though the new version introduces many new features.

*   Support for scenarios with longer simulation time. A scenario of 24 hours with 200 edge devices (2110706 generated tasks), took 1 minutes and 31 seconds on version 5.0 vs "not possible" on version 4.2 due to out of memory exception.

*   Updated dependencies (...and removed some).

*   Improved code quality and JavaDoc.

*   More refactoring to improve extensibility even more.

*   Reduced simulation time further by adding more parallel operations.

*   Improved orchestrator task placement which had also an important impact on the simulation complexity. 

*   Added Wan Up link and Down link bandwidths.

*   Added a graph topology, now the user can link the data centers as he wants.

*   A topology will also mean that the user can incorporate a routing algorithm of his choice.

*   Now, energy consumption of WAN, LAN, and MAN networks is measured, in addition to that of edge devices and data centers.

*   Now, we can define the type of connectivity (Ethernet, 5G, 4G, WiFi) of each device (in terms of latency, bandwidth, and energy consumption rates).

*   Now, energy consumption of Ethernet, WiFi, Cellular (5G, 4G,..) networks is also measured.

*   The network model is more realistic than ever before.

*   Latency is now more realistic and dependent of the update interval (The latency-sensitivity can be defined in milliseconds, and the update interval has no effect on the failure rate of latency-sensitive tasks).

*   Similarly, energy measurement is now dependent of the update interval, no need to decrease the update interval (which increases simulation time) to get precise energy measurement.

*   This independence from the update interval means that it can be set to high, which decreased the simulation time further, without reducing its accuracy.

*   Improved reliability (More exceptions handling + proper guidance).

*   Implemented the Null Object Design Pattern in order to avoid NullPointerException.

## üìñ Overview

PureEdgeSim is a simulation framework that enables to study Internet of Things on a large scale, as a 
distributed, dynamic, and highly heterogeneous infrastructure, as well as the applications 
that run on these things. It features realistic infrastructure models, allowing research on the edge-to-cloud continuum to be conducted. It
encompasses all layers of edge computing modeling and simulation (shown in the figure below).
It features a modular design in which each module addresses a particular aspect of the 
simulation. The Datacenters Manager module, for example, is concerned with the creation 
of data centers, servers, as well as end devices and their heterogeneity. Their geo-distribution 
and mobility, however, are handled by the Location Manager module. Similarly, the 
Network Module is in charge of bandwidth allocation and data transfer.

Edge computing simualtion aspects

PureEdgeSim brings together analytical and numerical modeling techniques. The 
network, for example, is modeled by means of adjustable mathematical equations rather than 
at a low level. Such abstraction facilitates simulating thousands of edge devices and 
guarantees the evaluation of the simulation state at any moment. Finally, since PureEdgeSim 
is a discrete event simulator, the characteristics of the simulated environment, like network 
traffic and resources‚Äô utilization, will evolve over time, thereby enabling support for online 
decision-making algorithms, a process that can be accomplished through the Workload 
Orchestrator module.

Each module provides a default implementation along with a set of adjustable settings to 
facilitate prototyping and experimentation. Thus, researchers can effortlessly implement 
their approaches without having to waste time specifying low-level details. Another key 
feature of PureEdgeSim is its extensibility, as it allows users to create and incorporate their 
own models without altering its codebase when the default models fail to satisfy their needs.
In discrete event simulators, the temporal complexity of the simulation is dependent on the 
number of events produced at runtime. To reduce simulation duration, PureEdgeSim allows 
for balancing the precision of the simulation and its duration thanks to a set of dedicated 
parameters. How precise the simulation will rely on the user‚Äôs settings, particularly the 
update intervals. Thus, the simulation will be more precise and realistic the shorter these 
intervals are, but it will also last longer.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important
---
*   The development and maintenance of this project requires a considerable effort. Thus, any form of contribution is encouraged. 
*   If you are willing to use the framework to implement your own project on top of it, creating a fork is a bad solution. You are not supposed to modify the code base to implement your project, but extend it by creating some subclasses. Unless you plan to redistribute your changes, you will end up with an incompatible and obsolete version of the framework. The project is constantly evolving and bug fixes are a priority. Your fork with personal changes will miss these updates and high performance improvements.
*   If you just came across this project and want to check it out later, don't forget to add a star :star: :wink:.

### Efficiency and Scalability 
A system is said to be efficient when it can maintain a specified level of proficiency without utilizing an excessive amount of resources, i.e., execution time and memory. Determining the theoretical time complexity of the given simulation is not trivial because the execution time depends entirely on the user scenario (i.e., the devices and tasks count, the mobility model, the types of resources, etc.) and the number of events that occur during the simulation. Furthermore, some parameters strongly influence the number of simulations and, obviously, the number of runs also directly influences the execution time.
To demonstrate the scalability of PureEdgeSim, a few experiments were conducted on a single Intel Core i7-8550U.

1.  A 10-minute simulation scenario with 10000 devices (ten thousand, which generated 1015000 tasks) took 72 seconds. 
2.  A 24-hour simulation scenario with 200 devices (total of 2110706 tasks generated) took 91 seconds. 
3.  A 60-minute scenario with 100 devices took only 3 seconds, meaning that the simulator was able to run through as much as 1200 seconds of simulated time in just one second of real time. 

Of course, this time is highly dependent on the complexity of the decision making algorithm itself and the number of generated events  (as more devices = more tasks = more events), which is why it took longer with 10,000 devices. That said, it is still faster than real-time and outperforms all CloudSim/ CloudSim plus based simulators that either struggle to start due to the large number of devices or run out of memory due to the large number of events generated.

It is therefore easy to conclude that PureEdgeSim meets the ‚Äúefficiency and scalability‚Äù criteria as it allows for simulated experiments involving hundreds if not thousands of devices and tasks and runs considerably faster than in wall-clock time. An important step to reduce the simulation duration and solve its dependency on the number of runs is to implement multi-threading to execute simulation runs in parallel, which is already supported by PureEdgeSim.

### Simulation Accuracy

As mentioned previously, PureEdgeSim offers the most realistic network, energy, and mobility models as compared to existing solutions. However, since it is a DES, the time complexity of the simulation is dependent on the number of events generated at runtime. To decrease simulation time, PureEdgeSim provides fast and complete control over the simulation environment by its collection of parameters, allowing users to compromise between simulation precision and length. Hence, how accurate the simulation is will be influenced by the user‚Äôs settings, particularly the update intervals. The shorter these intervals, the more precise and realistic the simulation, but also the longer it takes. 

### Correctness

The tool is said to be correct if it fully complies with the stated requirements, which can be verified by checking test cases. To verify PureEdgeSim‚Äôs correctness through unit and integration testing, several test cases have been implemented. Nevertheless, this alone does not provide an assessment of which portions of the code were tested and which were not, neither gives a percentage of the overall coverage of tests alongside the project source code. To evaluate the amount of code that the available unit tests cover, code coverage reports were added to the project with the help of the Java Code Coverage Library (JaCoCo). 
It is important to clarify that the concern of such test cases is the technical feasibility of the scenarios and not the evaluation of the simulation outcome. It is simply a matter of testing whether the given results are logically reasonable and not of actually validating them. To validate the software, a case study was conducted using the simulator. [At least 95% of PureEdgeSim code is covered by those tests](https://app.codacy.com/gh/CharafeddineMechalikh/PureEdgeSim/dashboard?utm_source=github.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=CharafeddineMechalikh/PureEdgeSim&utm_campaign=Badge_Coverage). 

This achievement was made possible by testing all the new features and also by the considerable decrease in code duplication since duplicating code brings neglect of testing. 
In conclusion, we can say that the proposed simulator performs as intended. Every function has finished without abortions and gave the expected output; All the input files were parsed successfully, and all the personalized models were integrated and verified with the predicted results. The plotting of the simulation results gave a reasonable graphical output. In terms of intended errors, such as incorrect inputs, proper error messages were displayed, and correct information was written into the log file. Moreover, the parameters can be modified, stored, and loaded without any error.

### Reliability 

Reliability is the ability of a system to operate consistently under specified conditions while meeting all requirements. When it comes to the components of PureEdgeSim, reliability is ensured by extensive exception handling that catches any error occurring at runtime. Consequently, the errors will not cause the execution to stop (unless they are related to critical parameters without which the simulation cannot continue). While testing it, the proposed simulator never froze and satisfied all functional requirements. Furthermore, data reliability is high since the models are read-only and unmodifiable, meaning no data loss is to be feared. The only files that can be modified are the output files and the configuration files, which can be restored easily to the default values. In addition, PureEdgeSim uses two continuous integration services: Travis  and AppVeyor , that automate tests and builds execution on Linux and Windows virtual machines, respectively. PureEdgeSim‚Äôs users will benefit from such services as any test or build failure will be communicated promptly, thus, ensuring greater reliability. 

## üë©üèΩ‚Äçüíª How to Use

There are several ways to use PureEdgeSim; however, it is strongly advisable to run PureEdgeSim via a Java development environment, like Eclipse IDE. A set of predefined examples is provided under the ‚Äú/examples‚Äú directory, which should allow anyone to become familiar with PureEdgeSim.
